    <p>
        Welcome to the Resources page! Here, I post resources on various topics that I have studied
        either in or out of university. Some topics may also include non-academic content, such as
        productivity, study tips, etc. All materials shown were created by myself.
    </p>
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
        After planning my degree, I realized that the number of topics I would like to rigorously
        learn exceeds the courses I can take in a 4-year Undergrad. Rather than taking a 12-year BSc
        or 12 courses per semester, I came to a compromise:
        <br><br>
        During my Undergrad, I would enroll in the courses/programs that would provide me with the
        necessary academic environment (i.e. professors, TAs, examinations, etc) I would find much
        harder to replicate through self-study. These topics include advanced
        statistics/mathematics, molecular genetics/biology, and biochemistry, which is why I have
        decided to enroll in the Molecular Genetics Specialist and Statistics Major programs.
        <br><br>
        As for the other topics I am interested in, I would self-study those topics during the
        summers between each academic year, and create lectures on the parts I found most difficult
        or dense (and hence, the motivation for the resources page on my website). These topics
        include bioinformatics, anatomy, physiology, pathology, neuroscience, immunology, machine
        learning, and data science.
        <br><br>
        By no means do I find any of these topics simple. If I could, I would have applied for a
        septuple specialist in all the fields, including my own. Of course, I can't (nor want)
        to do that, so this is the best compromise I have come up with.
