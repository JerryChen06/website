            <h1 id="about-me">ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I’m Jerry Chen, a student of the University of Toronto at the St. George campus. I
                am currently enrolled in the Molecular Genetics Specialist program, as well as a
                Statistics and Computer Science Minor. I have strong interests in molecular biology
                , medical sciences, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and many more that I
                will elaborate in this page.

            <h2 id="research-life-sciences">Research, Labs, and the Life Sciences</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was young, I was deeply interested in science and its frontiers.
                Beginning with astronomy in early elementary school, developing into biochemistry
                throughout middle school, and finally settling on molecular biology and genetics
                during high school, I have dedicated much of my academic career to the pursuit of
                knowledge within the Life Sciences. My dream is to decrease the presence of
                suffering in the world through the advancement of the Life Sciences.
                <br><br>
                In high school, I took as many AP courses in the sciences as I could, including
                Biology, Chemistry, Physics 1 and 2, Psychology, Computer Science, and Calculus.
                Now, at UofT, I have been able to pursuit this passion in the form of rigorous
                academic courses. In my first year, I took the main Life Science stream courses,
                including enriched equivalents of chemistry and math (i.e. CHM151 and MAT137).
                Having enjoyed BIO130, I found first year to be profoundly insightful, and it
                solidified my dedication to research within molecular biology. So, I applied to the
                Molecular Genetics Specialist program in the spring, and was accepted.
                <br><br>
                In my first year, I became acquainted with a myriad of laboratory techniques,
                including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fischer Esterification through reflux</li>
                <li>Use of IR, NMR, and Spectrophotometer equipment</li>
                <li>Recrystallization to determine melting point of an unpure compound</li>
                <li>Use of micropipettes for creating solutions</li>
                <li>Cycloetherifiction via catalysis</li>
                <li>Gel Electrophoresis on both allozymes and DNA</li>
                <li>DNA analysis using DNA Ladder on gel</li>
                <li>Preparation and execution of a PCR</li>
                <li>Assembly and Analysis of a Grätzel Solar Cell</li>
                <li>Bioinformatics Tools, including BLAST and GenBank</li>
                <li>Preparation of Restriction Enzyme Digestion</li>
                <li>Koehler Illumination and Phase Contrast Microscopy</li>
                <li>Microscope calibration with stage micrometer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2025, I decided to become familiar with more laboratory techniques,
                including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To come</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To ensure I properly understood these techniques, I made a short video for each one
                explaining the motivation, mechanism, methodogy, and applications.
                <br><br>
                After planning out my degree, I realized that 20 credits, three programs, and four
                years is too little to encapsulate all of my interests. At first, I contemplated
                taking additional years, but for financial reasons, decided otherwise. Instead, I
                dedicated myself to self-studying all the topics that I would not have the time to
                take a course for (see self-study section). My intention with learning various
                topics is to provide myself with a wide breadth of knowledge within the Life,
                Statistical, and Computer Sciences to further the frontier of molecular biology
                and genetics.
            </p>
            <h2 id="bioinformatics-math">Bioinformatics, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Although I had not been particularly interested in mathematics during Secondary school, I
                developed a strong interest for mathematical theory and applications after MAT137 and
                MAT223, which are Calculus with proofs and linear algebra I respectively. Moreover, I
                originally planned on enrolling in a computer science major along with a life science
                program, and thus took CSC148 and CSC165 as well. Although I am no longer pursuing a
                computer science degree at UofT, I am still planning on learning programming skills to
                aid in my productivity in research and everyday life. I believe that honing in on my
                mathematical skills will aid my pursuits in Life Science, as there is particularly large
                overlap with bioinformatics and statistical analysis.
                <br><br>
                I have done very little in terms of statistics during high school. Although I self studied
                AP Statistics during the summer of my 3rd year of high school, I did not take the exam and
                thus my qualifications for statistics is weaker than my other mathematics. That being said,
                I believe statistics is the most significant mathematical science for molecular genetics,
                especially when it comes to topics such as genetic analysis or bioinformatics. Thus, I am
                planning on enrolling in a statistics major in my 2nd year, and I am self-studying python
                data analysis libraries during the 2025 summer, including NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib.
                <br><br>
                By the end of summer 2025, I hope to have a working understanding of bioinformatics tools
                and data analysis libraries that will aid me in my research career.

            <h2 id="courses-taken">Courses Taken</h2>
            <h3>First Year (including Summer):</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>BIO120H1 and BIO130H1</strong><br>
                These are the first year biology courses required for all students in the Life
                Science stream. I greatly enjoyed learning about the process of transcription
                and translation in detail, as well as the inner functioning of the cell and its
                life cycle. Although BIO130 was the highlight of my first year, BIO120 was still
                very insightful, as it highlighted the nuances in natural selection and the
                relationship (or, sometimes, lack thereof) between form in function in nature.

                <br><br>
                <strong>MAT137Y1</strong><br>
                This is the first year math course for most students in math adjacent disciplines
                (e.g. actuarial science, computer science, statistics, etc.), as well as for math
                majors. Although the time I spent on this course exceeded that of all my other
                courses combined, the problem solving, derivation of equations, and application
                of calculus to both real and abstract problems gave me an extremely enriching
                experience I never thought was possible in mathematics. Since I enjoyed the content
                MAT137 covered, and am planning to take the continuation of the course in second
                year, MAT237.
                <br><br>
                <strong>CHM151Y1</strong><br>
                This is the first year chemistry course for chemistry specialists. Although
                CHM135/136 was recommended for Life Science students, having done AP Chemistry, I
                thought that the additional topics covered in CHM151 would be more beneficial. I
                enjoyed the organic chemistry portion greatly, particularly synthetic and catalytic
                reactions, and it encouraged me to take the higher level second year organic
                chemistry course (CHM249). However, the physical chemistry portion was not as
                rigorous as I would have liked, so I am taking physical chemistry for chemistry
                students in second year (CHM222) rather than the one recommended for Life Science
                students.

                <br><br>
                <strong>MAT223H1 and MAT224H1</strong><br>
                These are the linear algebra courses offered for those not in the math specialists programs.
                I enjoyed these courses greatly, particularly MAT223 due to its excellent coordination.
                After MAT224, I gained foundational skills in linear algebra that will aid me in machine
                learning and other statistical methods.
                <br><br>
                <strong>CSC148H1 and CSC165H1</strong><br>
                These are the first year foundational computer science courses for computer science
                students. Originally, I had planned to do a computer science major along with a
                life science specialist. Although I was accepted into the program, I decided not to
                pursue it, as I believed that a statistics major would be more appropriate to
                complement my molecular genetics specialist. That being said, the courses honed my
                python skills and improved my proof writing, which helps in all logic-based courses.
                Most importantly, the application of data structures (e.g. trees, stacks, and
                queues) have convenient and interesting uses in disciplines outside of computer
                science, such as phylogenetics Outside of university, I am still planning to pursue
                computer science in the forms of projects and self-studying.

                <br><br>
                <strong>MAT246H1</strong><br>
                This is a course in abstract mathematics, taken originally because I wanted to keep
                my options open for a math major. Since I decided not to pursue a math degree, it
                now serves as an elective course, but learning about modular arithmetic, the
                construction of the integers, combinatorics, and why the size of the real numbers
                is larger than the natural numbers, was still very fulfilling.

                <br><br>
                <strong>ECO101H1 and ECO102H1</strong><br>
                These are the first year courses for economics students. These courses were taken
                to act towards my breadth requirements. Although not directly in my field of study,
                learning about the science behind economies was still very interest. A particularly
                interesting topic was the implications perfect competition has on society and how
                capitalist systems, a system that works well on paper, can fail and lead to
                inefficient economies in which more people are worse off than they should be.
                <br><br>
                <strong>CLA201H1</strong><br>
                This is a course in latin and greek terminology in science, also taken to act
                towards my breadth requirements.
            </p>


            <h3>Second Year</h3>

            <h2 id="self-study">Self-Study</h2>
            <p>
                Due to my limited time during my undergrad, I am unable to take all of the courses
                that would interest me. Many of these courses include topics within physiology,
                cells and systems biology, computer science, and even psychology. As a result, much
                of my free time is devoted to self-studying these topics. Of these topics,
                physiology, machine learning, data analysis, and bioinformatics are particularly
                notable topics that I have since began to self-study.
                <br><br>
                To keep track of my progress within these topics, I have recorded “lectures” for
                each topic, which can be seen in the LECTURES page. These videos are not meant to
                mimic post-secondary level lectures, but rather to consolidate my own learning,
                present interesting topics, and improve my presentational skills.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2 id="why-built-site">Why I built a personal website</h2>
            <p>
                At first, I was simply interested in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and thought that
                developing personal website was a meaningful way to apply that knowledge. However,
                I realized that a website allows me to organize my ambitions, accomplishments, and
                hobbies into a passion project that would serve as a nice place to display the
                things that make up my intellectual and academic life.
